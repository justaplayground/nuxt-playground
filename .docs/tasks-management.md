# Prompt Changelog

## 0.1.1

1. Evaluate frontend framework options: Recommend React.js as the primary framework due to its popularity for building interactive UIs like drag-and-drop interfaces; pair it with Next.js for server-side rendering and full-stack capabilities, as seen in many modern Trello clones (e.g., using react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop). Alternatives include Vue.js for lighter weight or Svelte for performance if you prefer something more minimalistic.

2. Integrate UI styling: Since you're familiar with Tailwind CSS, use it for rapid, utility-first styling to create responsive components like boards, lists, and cards; it pairs well with React/Next.js and supports themes for dark mode or custom colors.

3. Decide on real-time features with WebSocket: Yes, implement WebSockets for real-time collaboration (e.g., task movements, comments) to mimic Jira/Trello's live updates; use Socket.io with Node.js backend or Channels with Django for handling broadcasts and conflict resolution in multi-user scenarios.

4. Select backend framework: Suggest Node.js with Express.js for its JavaScript ecosystem synergy with frontend, enabling easy integration with WebSockets and APIs; alternatively, Django (Python) for robust admin panels and ORM, as used in tools like Plane.so, or Ruby on Rails for convention-over-configuration if you want quick scaffolding.

5. Choose database type: Opt for a relational database like PostgreSQL for structured data (users, boards, tasks, relationships), offering strong querying for features like search/filtering; alternatives include MySQL for simplicity or MongoDB (NoSQL) if you prioritize flexible schemas for task attachments/comments, as in some Trello-inspired stacks.

6. Consider full-stack integrations: For a cohesive setup, use Next.js for both frontend and API routes (with Prisma ORM for database interactions) to simplify deployment; if separating concerns, combine React frontend with a Django backend, leveraging PostgreSQL as in Plane.so's stack.

7. Incorporate additional libraries: Add react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit for drag-and-drop mechanics; use Redux or Zustand for state management to handle complex board/task states; integrate Supabase for auth/database if you want a managed service with real-time capabilities built-in.

## 0.1.0

1. Identify core functional requirements: Define key features such as user authentication (login/signup), board creation, list/column management within boards, task/card creation with details (title, description, assignee, due date, labels, attachments), drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between lists, task commenting, and real-time updates.

2. Specify non-functional requirements: Outline performance needs like fast loading times, scalability for multiple users, responsiveness for mobile/desktop, security measures (data encryption, role-based access), and accessibility compliance (e.g., keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop).

3. Design the database schema: Create entities for users (id, name, email, password hash), boards (id, name, owner_id), lists (id, board_id, name, position), tasks (id, list_id, title, description, assignee_id, due_date, position), labels (id, name, color), attachments (id, task_id, file_url), and comments (id, task_id, user_id, text, timestamp).

4. Set up backend architecture: Choose a framework like Node.js with Express or Django, implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on boards, lists, tasks, and users, integrate WebSocket for real-time collaboration (e.g., using Socket.io), and handle authentication with JWT or sessions.

5. Implement user authentication endpoints: Build API routes for user registration, login, password reset, and profile management, ensuring secure hashing of passwords and token-based authorization for subsequent requests.

6. Develop board management features: Create APIs to create, read, update, delete boards, assign board members with roles (admin, editor, viewer), and fetch board data including associated lists and tasks.

7. Build list and task management: Develop APIs for creating/deleting lists within boards, ordering lists via position index, creating/editing/deleting tasks, assigning users/labels/due dates to tasks, and updating task positions after drag-and-drop actions.

8. Integrate drag-and-drop logic on backend: Handle API calls for updating task/list positions atomically to prevent conflicts, using optimistic updates with rollback on failure for multi-user scenarios.

9. Add commenting and attachment features: Implement APIs for posting/retrieving comments on tasks, uploading/retrieving attachments (integrate with storage like AWS S3 or local filesystem), and notifying assigned users via email or in-app alerts.

10. Design frontend architecture: Use a framework like React or Vue.js, set up state management with Redux or Context API for handling boards/tasks, and integrate drag-and-drop libraries like react-beautiful-dnd or Sortable.js.

11. Build UI components: Create reusable components for boards (dashboard view), lists (columns with scrollable tasks), tasks (cards with editable fields, labels, due dates), modals for task details/editing, and sidebars for navigation/filtering.

12. Implement authentication UI: Develop login/signup forms, protected routes for authenticated users, and user profile pages with settings for notifications and themes.

13. Create board and list UI: Build interfaces for creating new boards, viewing board overviews, adding/deleting lists, and dragging lists to reorder them.

14. Develop task UI with drag-and-drop: Enable creating/editing tasks via forms, display task cards that can be dragged between lists, update UI in real-time on drop events, and handle optimistic UI updates before backend confirmation.

15. Add real-time collaboration: Integrate WebSocket connections to subscribe to board updates, broadcast changes (e.g., task moved, comment added) to connected users, and resolve conflicts with last-write-wins or merging logic.

16. Implement search and filtering: Add frontend search bars to filter tasks by title/ assignee/ label/ due date, with backend support for querying filtered results efficiently.

17. Handle attachments and comments UI: Build file upload interfaces for attachments, display previews/thumbnail, and create comment sections with threading, editing, and deletion.

18. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility: Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap for responsive design, implement ARIA attributes for screen readers, and add keyboard shortcuts for actions like moving tasks.

19. Test core functionalities: Write unit tests for API endpoints (e.g., task creation), integration tests for drag-and-drop flows, and end-to-end tests for user journeys like creating a board and moving tasks.

20. Optimize performance: Implement lazy loading for large boards, pagination for comments/attachments, and caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to reduce database queries.
